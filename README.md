The holiday application starts with a spinner where the user selects a year between 1970 and 2050.
The application will execute the corresponding API call and will get the result of the Public Holidays API for the selected year.
While waiting, a spinning loader informs the user about the status.
Finally, a Recycler View shows the most greek important properties of the response from 1st of January to 31th of December.
